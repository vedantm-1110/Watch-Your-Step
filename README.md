# Watch Your Step - Independent Navigation for the Visually Impaired

## Overview
Watch Your Step is a mobile application designed to empower visually impaired individuals to navigate their surroundings independently and safely. This project utilizes cutting-edge technology, combining Java-based mobile app development with a machine learning model trained using the YOLOv5 object detection algorithm.

## Features
- Real-time Object Detection: Watch Your Step leverages YOLOv5 to identify and classify objects in the user's path, including obstacles, pedestrians, and potholes.
- Auditory Guidance: The app provides feedback and guidance to the user through vibrations, helping them navigate around detected obstacles.
- User-Friendly Interface: A simple and intuitive user interface ensures ease of use for visually impaired users.


## Technologies Used
- Java for mobile app development.
- YOLOv5 for real-time object detection.
- makesense.ai to train the images of potholes and pedestrians

## Usage
Open the application.
To start the assistance click on the Start Walking button, this will ask for the camera permissions.
Once given the permissions, it will open the camera and start assisting.

## Achievements
- A patent is granted by Republic of South Africa.
- Currently work is in progress to publish a research paper based on the experiences of this project.
